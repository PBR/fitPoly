Title: Genotype Calling for Bi-Allelic Marker Assays
Version: 4.0.0

Description: Genotyping assays for bi-allelic markers (e.g. SNPs) produce
	signal intensities for the two alleles. 'fitPoly' assigns genotypes 
	(allele dosages) to a collection of polyploid samples based on these
	signal intensities. 'fitPoly' replaces the older package 'fitTetra' that was
	limited (a.o.) to only tetraploid populations whereas 'fitPoly' accepts any
	ploidy level. Reference: Voorrips RE, Gort G, Vosman B (2011)
	<doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-172>. 
	New functions added on conversion of data from SNP array software formats, 
	drawing of XY-scatterplots with or without genotype colors,
    checking against expected F1 segregation patterns,
    comparing results from two different assays (probes) for the same SNP,
    recovery from a saveMarkerModels crash.
